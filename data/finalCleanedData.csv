 issue#:10",10,balupton,,"Compatibility, Preference",,,,,"Issue: Transitioning COVIDSafe app from BlueTrace to ENF poses technical challenges and shifts in health authorities' roles. This change, incompatible protocols, and the need for human-in-the-loop reporting make it unlikely to occur.","From the wikipedia page the government is arguing sunken costs and necessity for government interception.
 
 Transitioning from BlueTrace to ENF presented several issues, most notably that, as the app cannot run both protocols simultaneously,[107] any protocol change would be a hard cut between versions. This would result in the app no longer functioning for any users who had not yet updated to the ENF version of the app. Additionally, the two protocols are almost completely incompatible,[81][80] meaning the vast majority - all but the UI - of the COVIDSafe app would have to be redeveloped. Similarly, because of the change from a centralised reporting mechanism to a decentralised one, very little of the existing server software would be usable.[108] The role of state and territory health authorities in the process would also change significantly, as they would no longer be responsible for determining and contacting encounters.[108] This change would involve retraining health officials and penning new agreements with states and territories.
 Up until at least 18 June 2020, the DTA was experimenting with ENF,[109] however in an interview with The Project held on 28 June 2020, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Nick Coatsworth stated COVIDSafe would ""absolutely not"" transition to ENF.[110] He reasoned the government would never transition to any contact tracing solution without human-in-the-loop reporting,[111][112] something that no decentralised protocol can support.

 issue#:9",9,jimmo,,Preference,,,,,"Issue: The code for COVIDSafe v1.8 was released, but there are doubts about it addressing a connection problem. The issue involves a lack of timeouts in connection attempts, leading to persistent connection failures after multiple tries. Suggests adding timeouts to resolve this problem.","@covidsafe-support
 I noticed that the code for v1.8 was published today and became available in the app store a short while later. Although the code in CentralController has changed, I do not believe this issue is fixed.
 To re-iterate @wabzqem's quote from the documentation -- ""Attempts to connect to a peripheral don‚Äôt time out."" (ref). Additionally, the didFailToConnect event is only called if an transient error occurred during connection, so cleaning up there doesn't help. Apple's documentation says:
 
 The manager invokes this method when a connection initiated with the connect(_:options:) method fails to complete. Because connection attempts don‚Äôt time out, a failed connection usually indicates a transient issue, in which case you may attempt connecting to the peripheral again.
 
 (ref)
 So it's not clear how the new code can fix this issue, but just to be really sure, I used almost the same scenario described in my earlier post, but with COVIDSafe rather than nRF Connect. On a test phone, carefully shielded from and out of range of other devices, with empty payloads, I have a ""fake COVIDSafe"" peripheral that changes its MAC after every connection. After ~200 connections, it became unable to make further connections, and other apps similarly become unable to connect other devices. Terminating and relaunching COVIDSafe or turning off/on Bluetooth made it resume. Was able to reproduce this several times, and on one occasion I let it stay in the stuck state for over 45 minutes and it was not able to recover on its own.
 I suggest adding some sort of timeout to any locations in the code that call connectPeripheral. @wabzqem do you have a suggestion on the best way to implement this?",

 issue#:9",9,jimmo,,Compatibility,,,,,"Issue: COVIDSafe's connection problems, possibly related to a bug, result in frequent device disconnects and interfere with other devices. This is likely due to multiple pending connections, leading to disruptions when connecting with other apps like BLE Scanner.","This is almost certainly the cause of COVIDSafe causing some (maybe not all) issues with connections to Apple Watch and other devices. I noticed device-disconnects occurring more frequently when 1.2 was released (and when this bug was introduced), but assumed that was because the app was connecting more as the first background bug was fixed. Now I realise it's probably because this bug was introduced at the same time.
 
 With the assumption (based on what @wabzqem is describing above) that COVIDSafe is ending up in a state where it has lots of ""in progress"" pending connections, I was able to make a demo using two popular BLE scanner apps (""nRF Connect"" and ""BLE Scanner"") that could show how this explains the commonly-reported issue that COVIDSafe is interfering with other devices.
 
 Using whatever means, make nRF Connect find ~100s of devices. (e.g. a device that changes its MAC every second or something).
 Initiate a connection to each of them (each device will be stuck in the pending state, assumed to be the same as what COVIDSafe is doing as described above).
 Try and connect to a different device from BLE Scanner. Past some number of pending connections in nRF Connect, BLE Scanner will be unable to connect.
 Force quit nRF Connect.
 BLE Scanner will immediately be able to connect to that other device.",

It highlights compatibility with a significant percentage of devices globally, both with and without the latest software upgrades. The author suggests improvements to address issues with the current scan-connect-read-disconnect-pendingConnect approach in COVIDSafe, providing links to GitHub repositories for more details and documentation.","Dear COVIDSafe, I've created a solution that supports constant background scanning and device proximity tracking on iOS and Android. The solution does not rely on keeping the iPhone unlock and using a black screen to reduce power usage. It acts like an ordinary app, where the user can background the app, use other apps, and lock the phone indefinitely, while it continues to detect and track other beacons. The contact tracing app will work on 81.56% of devices globally without software upgrade to latest version. It does not rely on the Google + Apple API as I fear many users won't or can't upgrade their OS, thus it will only work on a theoretical maximum of 76.98% of devices today. The Bluetooth beacon underpinning the solution will work on 98.74% of devices globally (June 2020). It can even handle Android devices that can only act as a central, not a peripheral (e.g. Samsung J6). Please take a look at https://github.com/c19x
 The scan-connect-read-disconnect-pendingConnect|scan approach in COVIDSafe on iOS will fail when both devices are in background state (i.e. app not in foreground, device is locked) which will be the norm. They simply won't detect each other, until one of them comes to the foreground. Try the following ...
 Failure condition 1
 
 iPhone A and B in separate faraday bags (i.e. out of range of each other)
 Take A out, install and start app on A, move app to background, lock device, place back in faraday bag
 Take B out, install and start app on B, move app to background, lock device, place back in faraday bag
 Wait 30 minutes. This is equivalent to two isolated users installing their app and venturing out later
 Take A and B out, they won't detect each other until either A or B brings app to foreground
 
 Failure condition 2
 6. Continuing from 5, now that A and B are together and detecting each other.
 7. Move app on A and B to background, lock devices. Place A in faraday bag
 8. Wait 30 minutes. This is equivalent to two people meeting, then going out of range of each other for a while.
 9. Take A out of faraday bag, they won't detect each other until either A or B brings app to foreground
 This, and other related issues, have been investigated and a solution has been developed and documented for sharing. Please take a look at https://github.com/c19x/C19X-iOS-BLE

 The idea comes from filling your details out manually when entering a venue, some venues have paper sign-in, some have a QR code you scan (where most people don't actually fill out). So why not have a QR system in the app where a venue MUST scan your QR code in-order to enter.

 In summary, the app always required location permission. You would had previously given the app ""fine"" location permission (likely implicitly during installation). However, as of v1.0.39 it now requires ""coarse"" location permission instead (but doesn't use your existing ""fine"" permission that it already has).
 The app needs location permission in order to use some Bluetooth functionality (as technically you can infer location by detecting a BLE location beacon). COVIDSafe definitely doesn't use any other location (e.g. GPS) functionality though.
 Many users are being updated directly to v1.0.48 from much older versions, so it's possible you never had v1.0.39. This is because, in many cases, the app was previously unable to auto-update (even if you have auto-updates enabled), however this appears to be fixed as of v1.0.48.",

This issue appears to be related to the green ""COVIDSafe is active"" notification, which no longer displays on the lockscreen but is present in the notification drawer and status bar when the device is unlocked.","Possibly/probably an effect of the same underlying issue:
 When active, COVIDSafe 1.0.33 breaks the display of other apps' notifications on the lockscreen in Samsung OneUI 1.0 under Android 9/Pie on my Galaxy S8+/SM-G955F.
 Normally, a maximum of three notifications appear on the lockscreen in their usual form and any extra notifications appear below them minimized so they appear only as icons. See the screenshot below for an example of five notifications on the lockscreen (including COVIDSafe) when Bluetooth is off:
 
 But now, when COVIDSafe 1.0.33 is active, of the 1 to 3 unminimized notifications, only some ‚Äî if any at all ‚Äî of the text of the bottom notification (or of the only notification, as the case may be) appears (which is different to merely being minimized/iconified, as the notification title (and, where applicable, the subtitle) does sometimes appear, just without any notification content, and notifications with media controls do appear but only partially), and none of the minimized/iconified notifications (if applicable) appear below the 3 unminimized notifications at all. Sometimes not even the icon of one of the notifications that theoretically aren't even minimized/iconified is displayed, and so that notification becomes totally invisible, but the location where that icon should be can still be tapped to be shown in expanded form in the notification drawer. The green ""COVIDSafe is active"" notification is no longer directly visible in any form on the lockscreen, which is a change I personally appreciate for the decreased clutter, but which I'd also put good money on being the culprit behind this mess. See the below screenshots for an example of what should be four non-COVIDSafe notifications on the lockscreen (except the 'Do not disturb' notification is missing), as well as an example of what the lockscreen looks like when a media-player app is the only non-COVIDSafe notification not to have been dismissed (both screenshots were taken after Bluetooth was enabled):
 
 Note that my email address is no longer displayed in the Gmail notification (I like that very specific side-effect actually, but I'm just using notifications from Gmail as an example ‚Äî it happens with all apps). (NB: I choose to hide the content of notifications from 'Messages' on the lockscreen).
 
 When the device is still locked but the icon of a broken notification is tapped to expand its invisible(!) contents, the full notification drawer and notifications appear as normal and all is well in the world; the green ""COVIDSafe is active"" notification appears only as a small icon to the left of the 'Notification Settings' and 'Clear Notifications' buttons at the bottom of the drawer, which, again, if intentional behaviour, is personally appreciated, although sometimes it's only visible while pulling the notification drawer up to dismiss the drawer.
 If it bears mentioning at all for any reason, when the device is unlocked the green ""COVIDSafe is active"" notification icon is visible in the statusbar (although, again, apparently absent from the notification drawer itself unless you pull the drawer back up) ‚Äî I presume this, too, is mostly intentional, so, once more, it's appreciated and I hope this bug can be fixed without completely undoing these desirable changes.",

 An update to Tink has been released to more gracefully handle the underlying issue with the AndroidKeyStore, see the release notes for 1.4.0: https://github.com/google/tink/releases/tag/v1.4.0. (COVIDSafe is currently referencing 1.4.0-rc2). However, note the following extract from the release notes:
 
 Refactoring Android Keystore integration
 
 Running a self-test to only enable the integration if Android Keystore is working properly.
 Do not automatically generate fresh keys if keys exist but are corrupt. This won't recover corrupt keys, but at least it will allow to gather more data on Android Keystore failures.
 
 
 There is a related androidx.security issue: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/158234058, which may be relevant given that EncryptedSharedPreferences is copied from that library. There's an updated release of androidx.security that references the new version of Tink, as well as containing an unrelated update to EncryptedSharedPreferences, see https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/security#1.1.0-alpha02, which may want to be included in COVIDSafe's copy of EncryptedSharedPreferences.",

 issue#:15",15,jimmo,,"Privacy/security, Satisfaction",,,,,"Summary: COVIDSafe app simultaneously scans for and connects to other phones, requiring location enabled and permission for full functionality. Even with location disabled, it can still be detected by other phones, but bidirectional exchanges and encounters depend on others having location enabled to connect. The app's UI can be confusing, as noted in issue #13.","@wallarug The global ""Location"" enabled setting sort of acts like a global kill switch for the location permission in all apps.
 This app does two things simultaneously - scan for and connect to other phones, and broadcast presence to and receive connections from other phones. Whenever a connection is made (in either direction), both phones exchange eachother's tracing IDs and store them.
 However, the UI here is quite confusing - it's easy to be jn a state where the app says it isn't active but it's still detectable by other phones. Also the notification doesn't always say the same thing as the main screen in the app. See #13 (comment) for the specifics.
 To answer your question though, in order for the app to be fully functional (i.e. able to detect other phones running COVIDSafe) then you must have location enabled and the location permission granted.
 If location is disabled, then the app will still be detectable by other phones (and they connect to you). As all exchanges are bidirectional, this means that you'll successfully encounter log the other phones (and they'll log you), but of course this requires that everyone else has location enabled so that they can detect and connect to you.",

 issue#:13",13,vteague,,Privacy/security,,,,,"The app's behavior seems correct, though the UI/communication needs improvement. When location is off, the app may display an inactive message but remains functional. This approach addresses issue #6, allowing Android phones with location services off to respond and exchange TempIDs with others, even if they can't scan. Improving communication is necessary.","@saalkom I actually think the behaviour of the app is correct/good, though I agree the UI/communication is awful.
 I did the following experiment:
 
 
 Turn on phone's location and bluetooth, install COVIDSafe, scan for messages (with my computer).
 This works, as expected. My computer's scan can detect my phone's covidsafe msgs.
 
 
 Turn off phone's location, scan again.
 As you observed, COVIDSafe's main screen complains that it is not active, but it does not raise a notification.
 Here's the thing: it is actually still active, and my computer's scan continues to detect it, just as before.
 
 
 This is indeed, I believe, the correct way of dealing with issue #6, which @jimmo logged a few weeks back. See his explanation.
 Short summary: Android phones with Google's location services (i.e. global location setting) off will not be able to scan, but they will be able to respond. Since COVIDSafe exchanges its TempIDs both ways between the peripheral and the central, this means that the inability to scan will completely prevent two Android phones that have location services off from recording each other's TempIDs. However, having location services off shouldn't prevent an Android phone from successfully exchanging TempIDs with either iPhones or with Android phones that have location enabled.
 They could have chosen to do what the EN API does, and insist that location must be enabled in order to run the app, but this means that users are deprived of the option to run in this mode (location off) and live without detection of other Android users who have turned off location. I believe this is the right choice.
 But there is no useful communication about this, and the way the app communicates that it is not working when it is, in fact, (mostly) working is profoundly unhelpful.",

 You would prefer to use a mailing list over a single user's email for login, to guard against the single user losing access, and so the whole organization losing access
 But, you would prefer password-only login over a mailing list, because access to password vault is easier to guard than access to the mailing list
 
 If that's accurate, how about:
 
 Create a dedicated email address that will own the Healthchecks account. For example, healthchecks-admin@myorg.com
 Store credentials for that email address in the password vault
 To make logging into Healthchecks.io easier, also set a password on the account, and store that password in the vault too
 
 How does that sound?
 Just for reference, in case it's useful, here's what I currently do when I get requests to restore lost access. Say, an employee leaves the company and their colleague wants to take over the company account. In these cases I contact the former employee and get their consent to transfer the ownership. If that's not possible, but the new colleague 1) has the same company-specific email domain 2) is already a team member, that's good enough too and I transfer the ownership.",

 It kicks off a timer: the check now must receive a ping within the grace time, or it will go down

 Each integration has it's own:
 
 view function in hc/front/views.py

 I would probably never want the sorting to be arbitrary. As they are currently, they're sorted by the order in which they're defined, which is a good default.

 Requesting the ability to sort by name has really grown out of the increase in the number of checks I now have (31). As you've mentioned, it gets chaotic after a while, especially when you think of a new check and have some mild OCD that would prefer placing the check alongside, or injected between two other checks. For example, I recently added a schedule for resizing our application group instances based on the day of the week and the hours of the day. I have three base rules that run every day, and then more specific rules that run from Sunday to Saturday. In describing these checks to you, I've described them in a meaningful order; unfortunately, I didn't define them in precisely that order, so the days of the week are not in order, and nor are the general rules that run daily. The schedule grew organically. For this example, being able to sort by their name, or some other property that makes customizing the order possible, would restore order and make it easier to skim.
 
 Would it be for grouping checks together by their project / host system / role?
 
 I use tags to group by the type of checks, but even if I just selected a tag group, most checks would be out of order, because of the organic nature of creating new checks.",

 manage.py sendalerts gets an unexpected HTTP status code or a timeout back when sending an alert. When this happens, it retries 3 times with no delay. If still no success, it logs an error.
 
 
 manage.py sendalerts gets interrupted while sending an alert. It could be crash due to code bug, the system killing the process, or the whole system freezing or crashing. When this happens, no retries are made, and no error is logged.
 
 
 manage.py sendalerts delivers the alert payload to the remote system (e.g., it gets a 200 OK back from PagerDuty API). But the alert is lost further down the chain.
 
 
 I'd like Healthchecks to have a better handling of the second case. It's been at the back of my mind, but have not yet tackled it.
 The first case I'm not sure about. It would be nice to have things like exponential backoff and more than 3 retries for webhook integrations, but we also don't want 1) races between several notifications about the same check 2) too many spawned threads 3) the sendalerts process clogging up
 The third case I'd like to leave alone. Once the alert is handed over, and the remote system has acknowledged it, over our job is done.",

 This is a tricky problem. Initially Healthchecks only had ""simple"" checks and no /start endpoint, and the ""late"" status made perfect sense. Now with cron schedules, and with ""start"" events, the meaning of ""late"" is a lot murkier.
 I now sort of wish I had implemented /start in a very simple and limited way: store a ""last_start"" timestamp, and use it to calculate execution time on finish. And nothing more ‚Äì don't display a ""started"" status in dashboard, don't interfere with badges, don't send an alert if /start isn't followed by a regular ping on time. Of course it's too late now to change that, and drop features. Also, I suspect, if Healthchecks had just this simple version, there would be feature requests to show the ""started"" status in dashboard, and to send alerts when a started check is hanging for too long.
 I do agree that an orange ""late"" badge for started checks is not ideal: it is more likely to be interpreted as ""we have a small problem"" instead of ""all is well for now, but one or more checks may or may not go down soon"".
 
 let started not alter the ‚Äúok‚Äù status
 
 This is an option. There's a related problem with checks with cron expressions. Let's say the cron expression is ""0 * * * *"" (at minute 0 of every hour). In reality the job takes some time to run and so it reports in at minute 2-3 of every hour. As a result, for a few minutes at the start of every hour a badge would show ""late"" although everything is working as expected.
 Maybe we should just get rid of the ""late"" status for badges ‚Äì make it so that a badge can only ever be ""up"" or ""down"" (""late"" would count as ""up"").",

 I'm concerned about having locale checks being embedded in various parts of the data source as this makes it much harder to debug by introducing more code branches to follow.
 
 An alternative approach we can take is:
 
 Extract locale checks from TopSitesPanel into HomePanels.swift where we configure which panels to show. Here we can slot in a new 'Speed Dialer' panel without impacting other locales.
 Subclass 'TopSitesPanel' for the 'SpeedDialer' and implement the logic for keeping the tiles at the top. Ideally we would refactor 'TopSitesPanel' into a more generic 'Tiled Panel' class but we can address that when we start adding additional functionality to the dialer.

 Do we want to fade to dark gray in landscape orientation? It makes sense in portrait since we‚Äôre transitioning to a dark URL bar, but in landscape it feels out of place since there's nothing dark to fade into.
 
 Hmm ya it does feel out of place when just fading out those elements. I can revert to the same animation we had before where we faded out the entire URLBarView. @darrinhenein any thoughts?
 
 I noticed the URL bar doesn't immediately start fading away if I scroll from the top of the page -- I have to scroll a small distance first. We should probably start scrolling from the top like we did before (and like Safari does).

 I think TokenServerToken.uid should be a int64. The SQL schema for our server uses a BigInteger which is int64 on Postgres.
 Maybe you already have something in mind for error handing, but I was thinking of adding a isUserRecoverable or canBeRetried flag to errors that are returned. This does not make sense in case of malformed JSON of course, but if there is something like a temporary network error or a HTTP 5xx Try Later then we can set that flag which can result in code that retries later or some UI popping up asking the user to try it again at a later time. Right now it is difficult to see what is fatal and what is not.
 For all the different NSErrors, should we assign a unique code?
 Do we need to localize those errors? Not sure if they will be presented to a user. If true then we simply need to use NSLocalizedString() for the error message.
 Should every client have it's own Alamofire.Manager ? Or should we share a single instance that can be used for all http clients in this project? (I don't know)
 Instead of TokenServerClient.tokenFromJSON .. maybe it is nicer to have a TokenServerToken.init(json: JSON)? If that initializer returns an optional then it can also do the validation and simply return null if the JSON is invalid or incomplete.
 
 The tests look good. Are we going to add integration tests later that talk to a real token server? I have some at https://github.com/st3fan/bookmarks/blob/master/FirefoxAccountsTests/FXATokenClientTest.m - We can ask Services to spin up an instance on EC2 and run the token server.
 (To make testing this stuff easier I have written a REST API to generate MockMyID assertions. That means we can skip the MockMyIDFactory and just obain an assertion and key pair from a simple REST API and then submit that to production and staging token servers to see if our code is compatible against those. See https://github.com/st3fan/moz-mockmyid-api/blob/master/README.md)",

I thought about doing that but the output would be a little bit different from the current scenario.
 For example: Doing the way you suggested (Which I agree is the best) the fade out animation on the table view cell would start at the same moment the user tapped the cell. Meaning the user would see the cell animating to the deselected state.
 i.e:
 Tap
 See select cell animation
 See deselect animation while the next screen is animating.
 I did the other way because I didn't want to do that since all other cells are always selected until the user get back to that tableView.
 i.e
 Tap
 See select cell animation
 See next screen animation.
 It's a minor difference but I didn't wanted to change that behavior. Should I do another PR with your suggestion and close this one?

 it's simple, easy to understand but it could also frustrate users that ONLY want to protect the passwords and not the app itself
 
 
 Have separated settings for Logins and App
 It's more complicated, (2 different passwords?) Could lead to some confusions but it's easier to configure to your own expectations.
 
 
 My suggestion:
 
 Have a single option on the Settings page: Passcode
 Inside Passcode, add 2 toggles and the structure would be something like this:
 
 [ Enable Passcode ] - section divider
 Passcode for Logins - ON/OFF
 Passcode for App - ON/OFF
 [ Passcode ] - section divider
 Change Passcode
 Require Passcode >
 The password would be shared for both actions (Easier to understand) and we have individual toggles for each option, app and logins (enables user's choice).
 Toggling any toggle OFF would require the password to confirm, just like it's done today.
 Turning the first toggle ON would require to create the password, just like it's done today
 Turning the second toggle ON would require the password to confirm (since it's already registered)

It notes that background tasks execute more reliably when the device is plugged in. The message expresses thanks for feedback and plans to provide testing updates.","Hi @mss1010 & @PalminX,
 Thanks for your updates, they're much appreciated. Our team is looking into this at present, to determine the root cause of this issue.
 Here's some more details on our implementation. It's based on the sample code provided by Apple (see the link below). I've been testing this on 4 devices locally, using the following methods:
 
 Triggering simulated background tasks on device, to ensure our code for handling the exposure calculation is executed on receiving the background event, and
 Running the application overnight, and logging the execution flow of the background task handling to a file (so that the application doesn't need to be opened to check the risk status, which would otherwise reschedule the background tasks again)
 
 From the documentation below, Apple indicate that, by checking for the app's Exposure Notification entitlement, and using the specific background task identifier (i.e., with a .exposure-notification suffix), the operating system will automatically launch & guarantee more background processing time to the task.
 From our logging, we've also verified that setTaskCompleted(success: Bool) is called on the background task when executed, ensuring that the background scheduler does not flag our task as a rogue process.
 We've also noticed during our testing that background tasks execute more reliably when the device is plugged in. The tasks will still execute when unplugged, just adhering less strictly to the task's earliestBeginDate, which in any case is not a guaranteed execution time. In addition, we specify nil for the earliestBeginTime for the exposure-notification task. The ExposureNotification framework internally applies a earliest start time of 4 hrs to this task, regardless. From discussion with Apple, this is expected behaviour by design when using the BackgroundTasks framework.
 https://developer.apple.com/documentation/exposurenotification/building_an_app_to_notify_users_of_covid-19_exposure

 @SebastianWolf-SAP as one of the project's developers actually concluded correctly and everything needed to be said was said.
 The opinion can't be ""utterly wrong"" if the development team is using software, frameworks or APIs constrained by the vendor. It is simply not possible to ship software to environments, where fundamental software code the application relies on, is not bundled with.
 If there was a viable way of providing support for older phones (and especially OSs), therefore increasing potential audience to help detect infection chains, obviously the application would target the oldest/earliest possible deployment target. But again, this is not the case here.
 If you do not have a background in software engineering and don't understand this, I can give you a real life analogy, just ping me again.
 @richardbrammer
 On a side note: I personally don't expect Apple to ship a software update for iOS 12 (or earlier) to deliver these APIs. There is several reasons why this seems unlikely.
 To keep things organized, I vote for keeping this ticket closed until there is a valid reason to reopen.

But keep in mind that the app is only facing issues in a small set of edge-cases, we are already investigating this issue (as visible by the assigned status) and we have other issues with higher priority (e.g., the unexpected error codes from the system which we have to investigate together with Apple).
 
 I think there is a misunderstanding about the scope of this bug. It is not only happening in a small number if edge cases, but for every single device I checked it. I think in the first days some users maybe opened the app sometimes manually because it‚Äôs something new and interesting. But most users just will install the app ans NOT check it regularly. For these (which we can guess is a BIG MAJORITY) the app DOES NOT WORK. They will not get a warning about any exposure.
 
 Let me clarify my original bug report. The IDs get updated if the app remains open, even in the ebackground, but they don't if the app remains closed, that's the point.",

They acknowledge this behavior is controlled by Apple and plan to provide feedback to them.

 The COVID-19-Kontaktprotokoll is implemented by Apple.
 We will give this feedback back to Apple to improve this behavior in the future.
 
 Sure: The percentage depends on activities by other apps, it is relative.
 However: One can try to estimate what it means in absolute numbers. In my case the battery drained from 100% to 15% in 24h (85%). Multiplying with 26% relative usage of (Warn App + Covid 19 Exposure Logging) this translates to an absolute 22% battery drain within 24 hours.

 Current Implementation
 During the onboarding process, the app shows a view informing about what happens when you are tested positive. The text on this page says People whose encrypted random IDs your device has collected will now receive a warning... in the English localization and Die Personen, deren verschl√ºsselte Zufallscodes Sie gesammelt haben, erhalten nun eine Warnung... in the German localization.
 According to my understanding of the protocol, people who have collected an encrypted random ID of my device are notified. The current text may allow the interpretation, that the IDs my device collects are shared with the server in case of a positive test.
 Suggested Enhancement
 State clearly that people who have collected an ID of my device are notified.

It emphasizes the importance of public pressure on Apple and Google to provide backport fixes to older operating systems.,"Following that argumentation there wouldn't be a corona-warn-app, if both google and apple didn't provide a library for it?
 
 Precisely. Because otherwise you'd have to implement a lot of ugly hacks, as basically the bluetooth discovery feature is ""misused"" for this (you don't need to explicitly connect to a nearby device for this to work) ‚Äî and as modern OSs are heavily sandboxed there's just no sane way to do so without seriously endangering the safety of the users.
 
 @nathanlesage This is not exactly true / out of context.
 You are right, bluetooth discovery can be misused to determine nearby devices but for this to work the ""misusing"" application or framework must be running in foreground at all times.
 The benefit of the EN-Framework being a system capability is constant monitoring at all times and dispatching the ""results"" of that to the application whenever the application requests this.
 Reason why the EN framework is not publicly available for other developers, this could lead to heavy misuse.
 
 As I mentioned in another comment: We need public pressure on both Apple and Google to provide backport fixes to older versions of their operating systems. Hence: Let's take this to Twitter!

COVID-19 Exposure Logging accounts for a significant 21% of battery usage within 24 hours. The user attempted to replicate the issue, observing a slight reduction in battery drain on the second day, speculating that power cycling or initial calibration might have contributed. The conclusion suggests room for improvement in Apple's COVID-19 Exposure Logging component.","I also observed high battery drain on an older iphone. The package 'Corona Warn App + Covid-19-Kontaktprotokoll' together account for 26% battery drain.
 Phone
 * iphone SE (old)
 
 * ios 13.5.1
 
 * Corona Warn App 1.0.2
 
 Battery Usage (24h)
 * Corana Warn: 5%
 
 * Health (Covid-19-Kontaktprotokoll): 21%
 
 Compare: Other Battery Usage (24h)
 * Spotify: 23% (~ 90 minutes streaming via Wifi and Bluetooth Headset)
 
 * WhatsApp: 5% (11 minutes)
 
 
 
 Yesterday I tried to reproduce the behaviour from 'day 1' by charging my phone to 100% followed by a powercycle and then using it for 24 hours (without charging). Within 24 hours, the battery drained from 100% to 10%.
 
 battery usage of 'Corona-Warn-App' was only 1% -> ok.
 battery usage of 'COVID-19 Exposure Logging' was about 11%
 
 --> The battery drain caused by 'COVID-19 Exposure Logging' is reduced to 1/2 of what was observed on the first day: It still causes ~10% of the total battery drain within 24 hours.
 Wild guess:
 
 powercycling helped, or
 higher drain on 'day 1' was caused by s.th. like an initial calibration of 'COVID-19 Exposure Logging'.
 
 Conclusion from my side: The battery drain of the 'Corona Warn App' itself seems ok., but Apples 'COVID-19 Exposure Logging' has room for improvement.",

It explains the rationale behind Google's approach to protect user privacy. The author suggests that separating BLE tracking from the COVID-19 app, as Apple and Google do, is better for privacy.","Seems like you have to enable location mode in order to get Android to locate the Bluetooth device. It is a privacy orientated feature. if its disabled, every Android device will send the same Bluetooth-ID 02:00:00:00:00:00
 
 You are right, it's a privacy oriented feature. What Google wants to prevent is this scenario: An app does not get permission from the user to access location, and then still tracks the user's location by BLE-scanning for fixed-position BLE beacons (iBeacons in stores, museums, etc). Totally different use case, but leads to the requirement to ask the user for location permission, even though the location isn't used within the app.
 
 That's unfortunately also different to the ""official"" Google Play Services: There your app is NOT allowed to have location services.
 This is one reason why the official CWA app can't implement both things at same time:
 
 if you use the official Google/Apple API, you are NOT allowed to access Location - that's clearly stated. This is to prevent countries like France to track infected users.
 if you implement your own BLE scanning (as proposed here), you have to access Location for the reasons above.
 
 Both at same time wont work as you app would not be accepted for Play Store.
 Actually the approach with Google Play Services is in my opion better for privacy! It sounds strange, but actually the app itsself can't track the location of users if you separate the BLE tracking from the COVID19 app (what Apple and Google do). The play services are a separate service implemented on a lower level in the operating system. Those have all required permissions to do the BLE scanning, but don't expose any privacy critical information to the COVID19 app. That's well thought!",

 This is because this app is just a front end for an API that was developed by Google.

Also the dependency on Google API is a major point of critique: https://www.nachdenkseiten.de/?p=62113
 The solution is quite simple: Implement your own API, then you can make it available for older phones as well.
 Here, a single person now tries to fill this gap in his spare time. The motivation is different, he wants to get rid of Google API to make a true FOSS solution. But I see a lot of synergy here. A true FOSS solution of course also would allow to back-port the algorithm to older phones. There will be no limits any more, everything can be customized then. I am surprised that this has not been realized so far.
 Telekom and SAP should team up with this project discussed here. This would be a win-win for all. SAP and Telekom can make their employer happy (the employer is the German government, and the government are the people) and FOSS will be strengthened.",

It's an open secret that the Corona warn app is just a bailout for German IT companies. The whole point why every European country is doing its own app (instead of an European joint development) is that now governments can spend 27 times the money instead of only once. They just want to have a reason to give taxpayers money to the industry. That's it. If you understood this, then I think it is absolutely legit to ask something in return for it. And I think supporting an open source exposure API would be a great way to spend all the excessive tax payers cash.
 Especially since it is a long term goal of many German strategists to become independent from US IT companies. An alternative open source exposure API working on LineageOS or similar w/o Google services would very well fit into this strategy. To summarize:
 
 SAP got way too much cash from German government
 It is a very important economic, political and social goal to become independent from US IT companies
 
 Now we just need someone with a great vision. A manager who does not just look at monthly cash flows but at the long term well being of the company. Then it is absolutely clear that SAP and Telekom must support theScrabi and his colleges to create something independent from the big US IT companies.",

It warns that third-party apps could collect more data than intended, potentially identifying individuals. While supporting open-source solutions, the author advises caution and compliance with Google and Apple licenses.","I think it may be good to consider possible consequences of publishing open implementations of EN, normally I'm on board with fully open-source solutions, but it seems that in this particular case (distributed approach) it will enable easy ""nerd attack"":
 
 The DP3T app collects as little information as possible by design, but operates
 with an open protocol. This means that anyone can develop his own DP3T-like client, and
 possibly decide to collect more data than what DP3T meant. There could be ‚Äúenriched apps‚Äù
 which collect more information for each encounter such as the geographic location, the exact
 time, more information about the Bluetooth message. The app would make its best effort
 to link changing EphIDi, which would not be too hard from Bluetooth metadata and signal
 strength if there are not many neighbors in proximity and they are all static. The app could
 further invite the user to enter more data such as if he knows the person, their gender,
 approximate age, visible ethnicity, etc, or in which circumstance this encounter occurred (e.g.
 in bus line x, in the elevator of building y). The enriched app could easily create a huge
 database. With this, an isolated malicious user could start identifying many reported cases.
 
 It's already easy to build an app on e.g. Raspberry PI zero W which collects RPIs together with exact timestamp and GPS location, and then matches these RPIs with published TEKs (which can be continuously fetched with simple curl cron job since it seems that there will be no safeguards like Device Attestation). Then adversary will be able to determine exact time and location of contact with infected person, which in turn may result in easy identification of this person. This capability could be limited to developers who can implement this from scratch, but with open implementation I guess this attack vector may be much more popular.
 Keep in mind that users of official app are told that:
 
 Die App ist so konzipiert, dass so wenig personenbezogene Daten wie m√∂glich verarbeitet werden. Das bedeutet zum Beispiel, dass die App keine Daten erfasst, die es dem RKI oder anderen Nutzern erm√∂glichen, auf Ihre Identit√§t, Ihren Gesundheitsstatus oder Ihren Standort zu schlie√üen.
 
 and right before turning on broadcasting of RPIs further assured that:
 
 Die verschluÃàsselten Zufallscodes geben nur Auskunft uÃàber das Datum, die Dauer und die anhand der SignalstaÃàrke berechnete Entfernung zu Ihren Mitmenschen. PersoÃànliche Daten wie Name, Adresse oder Aufenthaltsort werden zu keiner Zeit erfasst.
 
 This is true if only official apps will be in use, but once we have enriched apps (developed based on open EN implementation) which provide fine-grained information about the encounters then above statement no longer holds.
 I'm a big supporter on fully open-source / libre software and I think a solution where users don't have to create Google account in order to participate in contact tracing would be much better, but unfortunately current approach does not ensure full privacy by design and open implementation may enable more adversaries to violate privacy of others.
 For those who don't want to use Google products one possible solution is to get cheap used Android phone from eBay, create fake Google account and carry it in another pocket (e.g. Motorola G2 which is capable of running EN costs 25-30 EUR).
 If you decide to go forward with publishing EN implementation just make sure that it does not violate any licenses from Google / Apple (e.g. Beacon Simulator app developer had to remove iBeacon format implementation from public source code, despite the fact that iBeacon specification is open)",

It mentions potential issues with error handling and asynchronous calls, and the author prefers using Android's native implementation for flexibility. They also note the use of Protobuf for larger payloads and JSON for smaller requests, with an exception for App Configuration from the distribution service.","The only benefit would be less code.
 
 I checked your reference code again. The Helper Class is about 70 LOC (without Tests) like you mentioned, however I currently do not need any Helper Class in Volley to induce a JSON Request. Thus the error potential here is higher when we switch to OkHttp since I do not need to rely on a Helper.
 Regarding your initial comment:
 
 Maybe a little bit more supporting both JSON and ProtBuf and implementing a general error classification system.
 
 I agree this needs to be done (specifically the error classification system), however this should be aligned also with the general exception handling method we use in our application and this is currently still WIP as mentioned in our docs.
 Maybe as additional context regarding the classes we use for building requests: We decided to use explicit RequestClasses for our most important HTTP-Calls to be more explicit about our call structure, but this is not yet final and could change.
 Regarding the asynchronous Calls:
 
 Reducing complexity (We do not need to do asnychrouse calls and than synchronize them with suspendCoroutine continuation any more)
 
 I tend to disagree here, as your call (referencing your helper class) just makes the HTTP Call synchronous, and we would thus need to rely on another way of spreading Requests on our ThreadModel and still wrap the actual calls with something like a fork-system or a queue (like currently implemented). In fact, if I look at the snippet of your helper you use the client.newCall(request).execute() method, which is in fact synchronous as you can see in the okhttp docs The only way to do this (to my knowledge right now, maybe I missed something) in OkHttp asynchronously is in fact by using callbacks, which would be then (just like now) be wrapped in a coroutine that suspends itself.
 I rather reference an android native implementation than OkHttp and some own coding here to be honest (and we can switch to OkHttpStack in case of security issues down the line as a base handler), we thus do not limit ourselves at the moment.
 All in all, I see more complexity in this stage of the project by introducing your change because we need to add helper functions, thread-managing code and still use blocking requests down the line (in the way you proposed), all that while still needing the tests for the actual purpose of the calls.
 As always open for feedback! Thanks, Jakob ÔøΩÔøΩ
 Edit: Regarding the Usage of both JSON/Protobuf: We mainly use Protobuf because of its advantages in payload sizes on big key packages, e.g. on the key files. We use JSON for smaller requests in general. There is an exception regarding the App Configuration because it comes from the distribution service.",

 This is because this app is just a front end for an API that was developed by Google. And Google of course wants to sell more phones, so they only implemented it for newer Android versions, not for the old ones. Also the dependency on Google API is a major point of critique: https://www.nachdenkseiten.de/?p=62113
 The solution is quite simple: Implement your own API, then you can make it available for older phones as well.
 Here, a single person now tries to fill this gap in his spare time. The motivation is different, he wants to get rid of Google API to make a true FOSS solution. But I see a lot of synergy here. A true FOSS solution of course also would allow to back-port the algorithm to older phones. There will be no limits any more, everything can be customized then.

It advocates for more substantial returns on taxpayer money and proposes supporting an open-source exposure API. The message also highlights the long-term goal of German independence from US IT companies and calls for visionary leadership to achieve this, with support from SAP and Telekom.","@hman2 Actually, it is considered way too expensive, see this: Corona Warn-App: Ziemlich teuer. It's an open secret that the Corona warn app is just a bailout for German IT companies. The whole point why every European country is doing its own app (instead of an European joint development) is that now governments can spend 27 times the money instead of only once. They just want to have a reason to give taxpayers money to the industry. That's it. If you understood this, then I think it is absolutely legit to ask something in return for it. And I think supporting an open source exposure API would be a great way to spend all the excessive tax payers cash.
 Especially since it is a long term goal of many German strategists to become independent from US IT companies. An alternative open source exposure API working on LineageOS or similar w/o Google services would very well fit into this strategy. To summarize:
 
 SAP got way too much cash from German government
 It is a very important economic, political and social goal to become independent from US IT companies
 
 Now we just need someone with a great vision. A manager who does not just look at monthly cash flows but at the long term well being of the company. Then it is absolutely clear that SAP and Telekom must support theScrabi and his colleges to create something independent from the big US IT companies.",

 We took the proposal and discussion seriously. It has been clarified internally and with the project stakeholders.

It warns of potential privacy risks, such as ""enriched apps"" collecting excessive data and the possibility of identifying infected individuals through data matching. While supportive of open-source solutions, the author emphasizes the need for robust privacy safeguards. They also suggest alternatives for users who want to avoid Google products and advise compliance with Google and Apple licenses for any EN implementation.","I think it may be good to consider possible consequences of publishing open implementations of EN, normally I'm on board with fully open-source solutions, but it seems that in this particular case (distributed approach) it will enable easy ""nerd attack"":
 
 The DP3T app collects as little information as possible by design, but operates
 with an open protocol. This means that anyone can develop his own DP3T-like client, and
 possibly decide to collect more data than what DP3T meant. There could be ‚Äúenriched apps‚Äù
 which collect more information for each encounter such as the geographic location, the exact
 time, more information about the Bluetooth message. The app would make its best effort
 to link changing EphIDi, which would not be too hard from Bluetooth metadata and signal
 strength if there are not many neighbors in proximity and they are all static. The app could
 further invite the user to enter more data such as if he knows the person, their gender,
 approximate age, visible ethnicity, etc, or in which circumstance this encounter occurred (e.g.
 in bus line x, in the elevator of building y). The enriched app could easily create a huge
 database. With this, an isolated malicious user could start identifying many reported cases.
 
 It's already easy to build an app on e.g. Raspberry PI zero W which collects RPIs together with exact timestamp and GPS location, and then matches these RPIs with published TEKs (which can be continuously fetched with simple curl cron job since it seems that there will be no safeguards like Device Attestation). Then adversary will be able to determine exact time and location of contact with infected person, which in turn may result in easy identification of this person. This capability could be limited to developers who can implement this from scratch, but with open implementation I guess this attack vector may be much more popular.
 Keep in mind that users of official app are told that:
 
 Die App ist so konzipiert, dass so wenig personenbezogene Daten wie m√∂glich verarbeitet werden. Das bedeutet zum Beispiel, dass die App keine Daten erfasst, die es dem RKI oder anderen Nutzern erm√∂glichen, auf Ihre Identit√§t, Ihren Gesundheitsstatus oder Ihren Standort zu schlie√üen.
 
 and right before turning on broadcasting of RPIs further assured that:
 
 Die verschluÃàsselten Zufallscodes geben nur Auskunft uÃàber das Datum, die Dauer und die anhand der SignalstaÃàrke berechnete Entfernung zu Ihren Mitmenschen. PersoÃànliche Daten wie Name, Adresse oder Aufenthaltsort werden zu keiner Zeit erfasst.
 
 This is true if only official apps will be in use, but once we have enriched apps (developed based on open EN implementation) which provide fine-grained information about the encounters then above statement no longer holds.
 I'm a big supporter on fully open-source / libre software and I think a solution where users don't have to create Google account in order to participate in contact tracing would be much better, but unfortunately current approach does not ensure full privacy by design and open implementation may enable more adversaries to violate privacy of others.
 For those who don't want to use Google products one possible solution is to get cheap used Android phone from eBay, create fake Google account and carry it in another pocket (e.g. Motorola G2 which is capable of running EN costs 25-30 EUR).
 If you decide to go forward with publishing EN implementation just make sure that it does not violate any licenses from Google / Apple (e.g. Beacon Simulator app developer had to remove iBeacon format implementation from public source code, despite the fact that iBeacon specification is open)",
